ChronosTool is a simple program coded in C++ to help with the data entry into programs such as Dr.chronos. 

Right now it is only programmed for my personal needs, hence the preset claims reasonings, however if needed, the CUSTOM entry can be used to insert and reason for a flag that you have.

Compiled with gcc.exe 

This code is still in development.
